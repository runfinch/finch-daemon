# Finch Daemon

The Finch Daemon project is an open source container runtime engine that enables users to integrate software that uses Docker's RESTful APIs as a programmatic dependency. Some core features include:

 - A partial implementation of the [Docker API Spec v1.43](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.43/)
 - Native support for Linux environments

The Finch Daemon project is actively taking contributions, especially to improve API compatibility.

## Onboarding & Development

Please review [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for onboarding, as well as for an overview of the development cycle for this project.
Additionally, check the [Makefile](./Makefile) for additional information on setup & configuration.

## Quickstart
Make sure [NerdCTL](https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl) and 
[Containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd) are installed and set up

### Linux
Getting started with Finch Daemon on Linux only requires a few steps:

1. Clone the repository - `git clone https://github.com/runfinch/finch-daemon.git`
2. `cd finch-daemon`
3. Install Go and make sure that `go version` is >= 1.22
4. Build and spin up the finch-daemon server with 
   ```bash 
   make
   sudo bin/finch-daemon --debug --socket-owner $UID
   ```
5. Test any changes with `make test-unit` and `sudo make test-e2e`


## Creating a systemd service
If you want finch-daemon to be managed as a systemd service, for benefits like automatic
restart if it gets killed, you can configure it as a systemd service on Linux by
following these steps:

1. `cd /path/to/finch-daemon`
2. `sudo cp finch.service /etc/systemd/system/`
3. Refresh the service files to include the new service - `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`
4. Start the service - `sudo systemctl start finch.service`
5. To check the status of the service - `sudo systemctl status finch.service`
6. To enable the service on every reboot - `sudo systemctl enable finch.service`
7. To disable the service on every reboot - `sudo systemctl disable finch.service`
